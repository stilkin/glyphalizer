  A live music visualizer for <strong>Nothing Phones</strong> that drives the glyph LEDs from microphone audio.<br>
  Designed for concerts and festivals -- hold your phone face-down and watch the back light up in sync with the music.
</p>

---

## What it does

BeatFlare captures live ambient audio, runs real-time FFT analysis, and maps the frequency spectrum onto the glyph LEDs. Depending on your device, LEDs are split into zones for spectrum visualization, bass VU metering, and beat detection flashes.

The visualizer runs as a foreground service, so it keeps working when the screen is off -- ideal for saving battery at a festival while your phone's back pulses to the music.

### Features

- **Live microphone input** -- reacts to ambient sound around you, not just on-device playback
- **Adaptive volume** -- automatically adjusts from quiet room to festival stage
- **Works with screen off** -- lock your phone and the glyphs keep going (saves battery)
- **Brightness slider** -- adjust overall LED intensity
- **Zone toggles** -- enable/disable spectrum, bass, and beat zones independently
- **Party mode** -- full-screen front-of-phone color visualization synced to audio
- **Notification control** -- start/stop without opening the app

## Supported Devices

| Device | LEDs | Glyph visualization | Party mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nothing Phone (1) | 15 | Yes | Yes |
| Nothing Phone (2) | 33 | Yes | Yes |
| Nothing Phone (2a) | 26 | Yes | Yes |
| Nothing Phone (2a) Plus | 26 | Yes | Yes |
| Nothing Phone (3a) / (3a) Pro | 36 | Yes | Yes |
| Nothing Phone (4a) | 6 | Yes | Yes |
| Any Android 14+ device | -- | No | Yes |

## Installation

1. Download [`beatflare.apk`](release/beatflare.apk) from this repository
2. Transfer it to your phone and install (you may need to allow installs from unknown sources)
3. **Enable the Glyph SDK on your phone** (required on Android 14-15, not needed on Android 16+):
   Connect your phone via USB and run:
   ```
   adb shell settings put global nt_glyph_interface_debug_enable 1
   ```
   This grants third-party apps access to the glyph LEDs. It expires after 48 hours, so you'll need to re-run it periodically. On Android 16+ this restriction was removed by Nothing and the step can be skipped.
4. Open BeatFlare, grant microphone permission, and hit start
